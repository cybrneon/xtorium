## Introduction
Xtorium. Best web browser available for everyone. Personal, so the user got all the power on the software.

## First of all
Xtorium hasn't been developped for years and is now obselete. If you want to develop Xtorium and update it, please do so.

## Getting Started
1.	Installation process: Just download it and copy the project directory to somewhere clean.
2.	Software dependencies: Does not require any additional software.
3.	Latest release: **Version 18.63.3.2**
4.	API references: Needs CefSharp.Winform (currently version 75, see [CefSharp](https://github.com/cefsharp/CefSharp)) or XEngine by adamclouder (optional)

## Build and Test
Latest versions only run on x64 computers, so if you want a maximum compatibility with Cefsharp, debug on x64.

## Browser features
Xtorium has all the functionnalities that any other web browser has. But some aren't working or aren't finished.

## Apps
These are "apps" that run inside the web browser eco-system. These can be special apps written for Xtorium or even just progressive web apps. Some exemples are Office Online Apps (Word Online, Powerpoint Online, Excel Online, ...), Twitter, ...
